I'm an ecologist and conservation scientist working at the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre ([UNEP-WCMC](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/en)). I am also in the final year of my PhD at [Plant Production Systems](https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/chair-groups/plant-sciences/chair-group-plant-production-systems.htm) in [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/en.htm).

I lead the UNEP-WCMC Nature Futures Focal Initiative, where we attempt to understand the scale and patterns of possible future biodiversity change. My research at Wageningen University focuses on agricultural systems and their inter-dependencies with biodiversity. I currently practice advocacy through my role on the [British Ecological Society's](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/) [ALDER committee](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/content/join-the-alder-network/).

I live in Ely, Cambridgeshire and enjoy good food, swimming wild, storytelling, and the odd video game.
